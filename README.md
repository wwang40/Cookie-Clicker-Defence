Cookie Clicker:
A game where you defend against enemy cubes coming toward your wall by using a turret and making cookies to buy upgrades. There will be a variety of upgrades and enemies get progressively more powerful. 

The game starts off on a start screen, with a start button. Once you click on the button, you enter the game. In the game, there are 3 main parts, the base, the wall, and the field. 
The base is on the left and is colored in blue. On the top left, there is a timer in white text, which counts upwards with seconds and minutes. In the upper center, there is a chocolate chip cookie, which can be clicked on to create cookies. Below the cookie, there is a dark bar that displays the number of cookies. Below the bar are upgrade buttons. On the left, there is a button with a health icon. This button heals the player and increases in cost with each purchase. This is the only upgrade that increases in cost. The upgrade on the right with a gear increases the number of cookies gained per second automatically. There are three upgrades in the center. Top upgrades bullet size, middle upgrades bullet damage, and bottom upgrades bullet speed. When you click on buttons they flash black. You can either click buttons or press specific keys.
In the middle, there is the wall. In the center of the wall is the turret which contains a muzzle. The muzzle follows the mouseâ€™s position. Bullets will spawn and shoot from the turret. The turret has a green dot. When you turn the turret, the green dot turns off. This means you are not allowed to shoot. This makes the game much more punishing for misses.
On the right is the green field. From the right of the screen, enemies come towards the screen as red cubes. Every 20 seconds, the monsters mutate, becoming smaller, faster, and different colored. When the enemies reach the wall, the player was a small window to still kill the monster. Once the monster reaches the blue, you lose health.
